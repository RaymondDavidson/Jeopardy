    """Sample function showing how to interpret the dialog exit codes.
    This function is not used after every call to dialog in this demo
    for two reasons:
       1. For some boxes, unfortunately, dialog returns the code for
          ERROR when the user presses ESC (instead of the one chosen
          for ESC). As these boxes only have an OK button, and an
          exception is raised and correctly handled here in case of
          real dialog errors, there is no point in testing the dialog
          exit status (it can't be CANCEL as there is no CANCEL
          button; it can't be ESC as unfortunately, the dialog makes
          it appear as an error; it can't be ERROR as this is handled
          in dialog.py to raise an exception; therefore, it *is* OK).
       2. To not clutter simple code with things that are
          demonstrated elsewhere.
